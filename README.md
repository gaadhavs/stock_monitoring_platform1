Stock Monitoring Platform

This project aims to create a Stock Monitoring Platform using Django for the backend and a frontend application to display stock charts with historical data. Please note that the frontend and backend are not yet connected due to time constraints.

## Backend (Django)
- The backend of this project is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework.
- Django is used to handle the server-side logic and data processing for the Stock Monitoring Platform.
- The backend code is used  separately to demonstrate my Django skills and knowledge.

## Frontend (React)
- The frontend application includes a feature to display stock charts with historical data.
- The frontend is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- The frontend code is be used separately to showcase my React development skills.

## Project Structure
- backend/: Contains the Django backend code.
- frontend/: Contains the React frontend code for displaying stock charts.

## Limitations
- The frontend and backend are not connected yet due to time constraints.
- The API request access for fetching stock data is currently over, limiting the ability to retrieve real-time data. The limit was 25.
